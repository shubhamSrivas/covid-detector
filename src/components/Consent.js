                This survey is part of a research study conducted by Rita Singh as Principal Investigator at
Carnegie Mellon University.
            </p>

            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>
                You are volunteering to record voice samples in order
                to help us develop algorithms to detect COVID-19 from
                voice. You will be asked to respond to series of questions
                about your health-related parameters and health status.
                You will also be asked to record a set of voice prompts.
                You may terminate the session at any time, without
                submitting your information.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your voice samples and the information you provide
                will be used for research purposes, and may be shared
                with other researchers as described in this consent form.
            </p>
            <h3>Purpose </h3>
            <p>
                This study aims to collect voice samples from and
                COVID-19-infected human subjects, along with minimal
                related demographic information, in order to develop
                algorithms to detect COVID-19 from voice.
            </p>
            <p>
                Given the widespread nature of the disease and the severe shortage of testing facilities around the
                world, if such a system were to be developed, it would give millions of people the ability to
                monitor themselves cheaply, and potentially save thousands of lives.
            </p>
            <p></p>
            Please note this study is gathering information for research purposes only. We are not providing you
            with any health advice or diagnosing if you have COVID-19. In order to develop robust detectors for
            COVID-19 using voice, a large-scale collection of voices from thousands of diagnosed COVID-19 patients
            will be necessary. By consenting to this collection, you will be contributing to that effort.
            <p></p>

            <h3>Procedures</h3>
            <p>
                You will be required to create a user name and set a
                password in order to participate.  You can elect to
                provide an email address that could be used in password
                recovery but an email address is not required.
            </p>
            <p>
                You will be asked to provide information about your age,
                height, ethnicity, health status, other respiratory
                ailments you may have, whether you have been diagnosed
                with COVID-19 (and if so the number of days since the
                diagnosis, whether you have recovered, and the number of
                days since you have been declared free of the disease), your
                current location, and your most recent destination if you have
                travelled in the past month. You may choose not to answer any
                of these questions.
            </p>
            <p>
                You will also be asked to record coughs, long vowels, and short
                recordings, such as counting up from 0-20 and the alphabet.
                You should do this in a private space or environment where other
                individuals or loud noises will not be captured in your recordings.
                You will have a chance to verify your recording before you decide
                to upload it.
            </p>
            <p>
                The entire study is expected to take about 10 minutes.
